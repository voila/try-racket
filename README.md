A web-based Racket REPL and tutorial.

Try Racket is written in Racket and JavaScript with Chris Done's [jquery-console](https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console).
   
It borrows a lot of code and content from [Try Clojure](http://www.tryclj.com/) and [paste.rkt](https://github.com/samth/paste.rkt).

## How to run it locally
    
    $ racket main.rkt
    
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
