<p>Yay! It works!</p>

  By now, you probably think that Racket is very different from the programming languages you already know.
  Indeed, it belongs to a different family than most popular languages' - the family of "functional" programming languages.
  Like most functional languages, Racket can define a function without even giving it a name:
</p>

<code class="expr">(lambda (x) (* x x))</code>

<p>
  If you run this code, you'll see some cryptic output.
  In Racket, functions are just normal values like numbers or strings.
  <code>lambda</code> defines a function and then returns it.
  What you're seeing is simply what a function looks like when you print it on the screen.
</p>

<p>
  But wait - an anonymous function isn't very useful if you can't call it. Try to define a new anonymous function and call it straight away: <code class="expr">((lambda (x) (* x x)) 10)</code>.
</p>
